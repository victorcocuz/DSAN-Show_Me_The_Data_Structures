## Problem 1 - Least Recently Used Cache
We have briefly discussed caching as part of a practice problem while studying hash maps.

The lookup operation (i.e., `get()`) and `put()` / `set()` is supposed to be fast for a cache memory.

While doing the `get()` operation, if the entry is found in the cache, it is known as a `cache hit`. If, however, the entry is not found, it is known as a `cache miss`.

When designing a cache, we also place an upper bound on the size of the cache. If the cache is full and we want to add a new entry to the cache, we use some criteria to remove an element. After removing an element, we use the `put()` operation to insert the new element. The remove operation should also be fast.

For our first problem, the goal will be to design a data structure known as a **Last Recently Used (LRU)** cache. An LRU cache is a type of cache in which we remove the least recently used entry when the cache memory reaches its limit. For the current problem, consider both `get` and `set` operations as an `use operation`.

Your job is to use an appropriate data structure(s) to implement the cache.

In case of a `cache hit`, your `get()` operation should return the appropriate value.
In case of a `cache miss`, your `get()` should return -1.
While putting an element in the cache, your `put()` / `set() `operation must insert the element. If the cache is full, you must write code that removes the least recently used entry first and then insert the element.
All operations must take `O(1)` time.

For the current problem, you can consider the size of `cache = 5`.

Here is some boiler plate code and some example test cases to get you started on this problem:

```
class LRU_Cache(object):

    def __init__(self, capacity):
        # Initialize class variables
        pass

    def get(self, key):
        # Retrieve item from provided key. Return -1 if nonexistent. 
        pass

    def set(self, key, value):
        # Set the value if the key is not present in the cache. If the cache is at capacity remove the oldest item. 
        pass

our_cache = LRU_Cache(5)

our_cache.set(1, 1);
our_cache.set(2, 2);
our_cache.set(3, 3);
our_cache.set(4, 4);


our_cache.get(1)       # returns 1
our_cache.get(2)       # returns 2
our_cache.get(9)      # returns -1 because 9 is not present in the cache

our_cache.set(5, 5) 
our_cache.set(6, 6)

our_cache.get(3)      # returns -1 because the cache reached it's capacity and 3 was the least recently used entry
```

## Finding Files
For this problem, the goal is to write code for finding all files under a directory (and all directories beneath it) that end with ".c"

Here is an example of a test directory listing, which can be downloaded [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-dsand/testdir.zip):

```
./testdir
./testdir/subdir1
./testdir/subdir1/a.c
./testdir/subdir1/a.h
./testdir/subdir2
./testdir/subdir2/.gitkeep
./testdir/subdir3
./testdir/subdir3/subsubdir1
./testdir/subdir3/subsubdir1/b.c
./testdir/subdir3/subsubdir1/b.h
./testdir/subdir4
./testdir/subdir4/.gitkeep
./testdir/subdir5
./testdir/subdir5/a.c
./testdir/subdir5/a.h
./testdir/t1.c
./testdir/t1.h
```

Python's `os` module will be usefulâ€”in particular, you may want to use the following resources:
* os.path.isdir(path)
* os.path.isfile(path)
* os.listdir(directory)
* os.path.join(...)

**Note:** `os.walk()` is a handy Python method which can achieve this task very easily. However, for this problem you are not allowed to use `os.walk()`.

Here is some code for the function to get you started:

```

def find_files(suffix, path):
    """
    Find all files beneath path with file name suffix.

    Note that a path may contain further subdirectories
    and those subdirectories may also contain further subdirectories.

    There are no limit to the depth of the subdirectories can be.

    Args:
      suffix(str): suffix if the file name to be found
      path(str): path of the file system

    Returns:
       a list of paths
    """
    return None
```

### OS Module Exploration Code
```
## Locally save and call this file ex.py ##

# Code to demonstrate the use of some of the OS modules in python

import os

# Let us print the files in the directory in which you are running this script
print (os.listdir("."))

# Let us check if this file is indeed a file!
print (os.path.isfile("./ex.py"))

# Does the file end with .py?
print ("./ex.py".endswith(".py"))
```

## Overview - Data Compression
In general, a data compression algorithm reduces the amount of memory (bits) required to represent a message (data). The compressed data, in turn, helps to reduce the transmission time from a sender to receiver. The sender encodes the data, and the receiver decodes the encoded data. As part of this problem, you have to implement the logic for both encoding and decoding.

A data compression algorithm could be either *lossy* or *lossless*, meaning that when compressing the data, there is a loss (lossy) or no loss (lossless) of information. The **Huffman Coding** is a *lossless* data compression algorithm. Let us understand the two phases - encoding and decoding with the help of an example.

### A. Huffman Encoding
Assume that we have a string message `AAAAAAABBBCCCCCCCDDEEEEEE `comprising of 25 characters to be encoded. The string message can be an unsorted one as well. We will have two phases in encoding - building the Huffman tree (a binary tree), and generating the encoded data. The following steps illustrate the Huffman encoding:

#### Phase I - Build the Huffman Tree
A Huffman tree is built in a bottom-up approach.

1. First, determine the frequency of each character in the message. In our example, the following table presents the frequency of each character:
* A 7
* B 3
* C 7
* D 2
* E 6

2. Each row in the table above can be represented as a *node *having a character, frequency, left child, and right child. In the next step, we will repeatedly require to pop-out the node having the lowest frequency. Therefore, build and sort a *list* of nodes in the order lowest to highest frequencies. Remember that a *list* preserves the order of elements in which they are appended.

We would need our *list* to work as a priority queue, where a node that has lower frequency should have a higher priority to be popped-out.

Can you come up with other data structures to create a priority queue? How about using a min-heap instead of a list? You are free to choose from anyone.

3. Pop-out two nodes with the minimum frequency from the *priority queue* created in the above step.

4. Create a new node with a frequency equal to the sum of the two nodes picked in the above step. This new node would become an *internal node* in the Huffman tree, and the two nodes would become the children. The lower frequency node becomes a left child, and the higher frequency node becomes the right child. Reinsert the newly created node back into the priority queue.

**Do you think that this reinsertion requires the sorting of priority queue again?** If yes, then a *min-heap* could be a better choice due to the lower complexity of sorting the elements, every time there is an insertion.

5. Repeat steps #3 and #4 until there is a single element left in the priority queue.

6. For each node, in the Huffman tree, assign a bit `0` for left child and a `1` for right child. See the final Huffman tree for our example:

#### Phase II - Generate the Encoded Data
7. Based on the Huffman tree, generate unique binary code for each character of our string message. For this purpose, you'd have to traverse the path from root to the leaf node.
* D - 2 - 000
* B - 3 - 001
* E - 6 - 01
* A - 7 - 10
* c - 7 - 11

**Points to Notice**

* Notice that the whole code for any character is ***not*** a prefix of any other code. Hence, the Huffman code is called a **Prefix code**.
* Notice that the binary code is shorter for the more frequent character, and vice-versa.
* The Huffman code is generated in such a way that the entire string message would now require a much lesser amount of memory in binary form.
* Notice that each node present in the original *priority queue* has become a *leaf node* in the final Huffman tree.

This way, our encoded data would be `1010101010101000100100111111111111111000000010101010101`

### B. Huffman Decoding
Once we have the encoded data, and the (pointer to the root of) Huffman tree, we can easily decode the encoded data using the following steps:

1. Declare a blank decoded string
2. Pick a bit from the encoded data, traversing from left to right.
3. Start traversing the Huffman tree from the root.
* If the current bit of encoded data is 0, move to the left child, else move to the right child of the tree if the current bit is 1.
* If a leaf node is encountered, append the (alphabetical) character of the leaf node to the decoded string.
4. Repeat steps #2 and #3 until the encoded data is completely traversed.

You will have to implement the logic for both encoding and decoding in the following template. Also, you will need to create the sizing schemas to present a summary.

```
mport sys

def huffman_encoding(data):
    pass

def huffman_decoding(data,tree):
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    codes = {}

    a_great_sentence = "The bird is the word"

    print ("The size of the data is: {}\n".format(sys.getsizeof(a_great_sentence)))
    print ("The content of the data is: {}\n".format(a_great_sentence))

    encoded_data, tree = huffman_encoding(a_great_sentence)

    print ("The size of the encoded data is: {}\n".format(sys.getsizeof(int(encoded_data, base=2))))
    print ("The content of the encoded data is: {}\n".format(encoded_data))

    decoded_data = huffman_decoding(encoded_data, tree)

    print ("The size of the decoded data is: {}\n".format(sys.getsizeof(decoded_data)))
    print ("The content of the encoded data is: {}\n".format(decoded_data))
```

## Active Directory
In Windows Active Directory, a group can consist of user(s) and group(s) themselves. We can construct this hierarchy as such. Where User is represented by str representing their ids.

```
class Group(object):
    def __init__(self, _name):
        self.name = _name
        self.groups = []
        self.users = []

    def add_group(self, group):
        self.groups.append(group)

    def add_user(self, user):
        self.users.append(user)

    def get_groups(self):
        return self.groups

    def get_users(self):
        return self.users

    def get_name(self):
        return self.name


parent = Group("parent")
child = Group("child")
sub_child = Group("subchild")

sub_child_user = "sub_child_user"
sub_child.add_user(sub_child_user)

child.add_group(sub_child)
parent.add_group(child)
```

Write a function that provides an efficient look up of whether the user is in a group.

```
def is_user_in_group(user, group):
    """
    Return True if user is in the group, False otherwise.

    Args:
      user(str): user name/id
      group(class:Group): group to check user membership against
    """
    return None
```

## Blockchain
A Blockchain is a sequential chain of records, similar to a linked list. Each block contains some information and how it is connected related to the other blocks in the chain. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. For our blockchain we will be using a SHA-256 hash, the Greenwich Mean Time when the block was created, and text strings as the data.

Use your knowledge of linked lists and hashing to create a blockchain implementation.

We can break the blockchain down into three main parts.

First is the information hash:

```
import hashlib

def calc_hash(self):
      sha = hashlib.sha256()

      hash_str = "We are going to encode this string of data!".encode('utf-8')

      sha.update(hash_str)

      return sha.hexdigest()
```

We do this for the information we want to store in the block chain such as transaction time, data, and information like the previous chain.

The next main component is the block on the blockchain:

```
class Block:

    def __init__(self, timestamp, data, previous_hash):
      self.timestamp = timestamp
      self.data = data
      self.previous_hash = previous_hash
      self.hash = self.calc_hash()
```

Above is an example of attributes you could find in a `Block` class.

Finally you need to link all of this together in a block chain, which you will be doing by implementing it in a linked list. All of this will help you build up to a simple but full blockchain implementation!

## Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists
Your task for this problem is to fill out the union and intersection functions. The union of two sets A and B is the set of elements which are in A, in B, or in both A and B. The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A âˆ© B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B.

You will take in two linked lists and return a linked list that is composed of either the union or intersection, respectively. Once you have completed the problem you will create your own test cases and perform your own run time analysis on the code.

We have provided a code template below, you are not required to use it:

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

    def __repr__(self):
        return str(self.value)


class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    def __str__(self):
        cur_head = self.head
        out_string = ""
        while cur_head:
            out_string += str(cur_head.value) + " -> "
            cur_head = cur_head.next
        return out_string


    def append(self, value):

        if self.head is None:
            self.head = Node(value)
            return

        node = self.head
        while node.next:
            node = node.next

        node.next = Node(value)

    def size(self):
        size = 0
        node = self.head
        while node:
            size += 1
            node = node.next

        return size

def union(llist_1, llist_2):
    # Your Solution Here
    pass

def intersection(llist_1, llist_2):
    # Your Solution Here
    pass


# Test case 1

linked_list_1 = LinkedList()
linked_list_2 = LinkedList()

element_1 = [3,2,4,35,6,65,6,4,3,21]
element_2 = [6,32,4,9,6,1,11,21,1]

for i in element_1:
    linked_list_1.append(i)

for i in element_2:
    linked_list_2.append(i)

print (union(linked_list_1,linked_list_2))
print (intersection(linked_list_1,linked_list_2))

# Test case 2

linked_list_3 = LinkedList()
linked_list_4 = LinkedList()

element_1 = [3,2,4,35,6,65,6,4,3,23]
element_2 = [1,7,8,9,11,21,1]

for i in element_1:
    linked_list_3.append(i)

for i in element_2:
    linked_list_4.append(i)

print (union(linked_list_3,linked_list_4))
print (intersection(linked_list_3,linked_list_4))
```
