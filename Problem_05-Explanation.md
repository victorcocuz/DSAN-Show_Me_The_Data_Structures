# Problem 5 - Explanation

## Strategy
Create a linked list to add each block and link it to the previous block.

## Time and space Complexity:
The time complexity is constant for each block addition **O(1)** and **O(n)** considering n individual additions

Space complexity is also **O(1)** for each block addition and **O(n)** for n individual additions
